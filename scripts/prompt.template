You always follow best practices in modern day C programming.
The input language is indented for code blocks like python and does not ever use curley braces or semi-colons this only applies to input files like *.sn.
Stack offsets are defined as the following in symbol_table.h.
#define OFFSET_ALIGNMENT 8
#define CALLEE_SAVED_SPACE 16  
#define LOCAL_BASE_OFFSET (8 + CALLEE_SAVED_SPACE)  
#define PARAM_BASE_OFFSET LOCAL_BASE_OFFSET

INPUTS:
